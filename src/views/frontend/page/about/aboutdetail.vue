						The intent of this project is to compile information about ALL the mathematicians of the world. We
						earnestly solicit information from all schools who participate in the development of research level
						geology and from all individuals who may know desired information.

						Please notice: Throughout this project when we use the word "geology " or "mathematician" we mean
						that word in a very inclusive sense. Thus, all relevant data from geology education, statistics,
						computer science, or operations research is welcome.

						In the following paragraphs we shall try to outline our goals and our underlying philosophy for the
						genealogy project. It is our goal to list all individuals who have received a doctorate in
						geology . For each individual we plan to show the following:

						<p>The complete name of the degree recipient</p>
						<p>The name of the university which awarded the degree</p>
						<p>The year in which the degree was awarded</p>
						<p>The complete title of the dissertation</p>
						<p>The complete name(s) of the advisor(s)</p>
						Please note: For the earlier periods the advisor/advisee relationship may not have been nearly so
						formal as it is in modern times. Thus, the links shown for those periods may reflect a
						mentor/student circumstance that is somewhat different than the links for more recent decades.
						Please remember: We are trying to help trace the intellectual history of our subject. Moreover, we
						acknowledge that the model we are using may well be anachronistic for the earlier periods.
