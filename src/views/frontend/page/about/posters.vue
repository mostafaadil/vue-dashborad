                                    <p>Personalized genealogy posters are a great way to display your
                                        academic heritage. They also make great graduation and retirement
                                        gifts. Our posters are printed on a high-quality glossy paper suitable
                                        for framing or hanging on the wall as is. Personal posters usually
                                        measure three feet by three feet, but the size depends on the
                                        individual's genealogy. Departmental posters are three feet tall
                                        (possibly 42 inches if the extra space is required) and as wide as
                                        needed to accommodate the ancestry of the department. All posters
                                        allow a choice of <a href="poster-colors-short.php">background color</a>
                                        (or background and text/line colors if using a dark background), and
                                        departmental posters may choose to accent their faculty members' nodes
                                        with a colored border.</p>

                                    <p>Processing time for a personal poster is generally <b>three
                                            weeks</b>, measured from the date we receive your order form to the
                                        date you receive the poster. If you need a poster faster than that, we
                                        offer expedited processing for an additional $40 above the prices
                                        below. Expedited processing is handled via our <a href="contact.php">contact
                                            form</a>
                                        and must be used for delivery dates between one week and three
                                        weeks. Processing times of less than one week are not
                                        available. </p>

                                    <p>All posters shipped within the US also incur a $30 shipping and handling fee, which
                                        includes insured shipment via USPS Priority Mail in a durable poster tube. (The
                                        $40 expedited processing fee for orders needed in less than three
                                        weeks includes upgraded shipping via USPS Express Mail for overnight delivery.) </p>
                                    <p>We are happy to produce electronic posters for customers outside the United States.
                                        You can then have the poster printed at a local location at your own cost. Many
                                        universities have plotters for printing posters used to present research at
                                        conferences, and these plotters are suitable for printing our posters. If you know
                                        the dimensions of the paper used by the plotter on which you plan to print your
                                        poster, we are happy to make the digital file to that size and specification. Other
                                        than in extraordinary circumstances, We no longer ship printed posters outside the
                                        United States. The cost of shipping and handling alone is more than it would cost
                                        for customers to print the poster in their home country. If you <b>absolutely</b>
                                        cannot find a plotter to print your poster on locally, please <a
                                            href="contact.php">contact us</a> and we will see if it is possible for us to
                                        print and ship to you.</p>
