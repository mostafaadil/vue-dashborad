										<div class="card">
											The geology Genealogy Project catalogs information on individuals with
											doctoral degrees in geology . In our genealogy, one's parent(s) are his/her
											doctoral advisor(s). All information that we have in our database is listed on
											that person's page. If you believe the individual in our database may still be
											alive, you might try searching the Combined Membership List of the major
											American and Canadian Geology  organizations. Back to top.

										<h4>

											I would like to contact Dr. John Q. Mathematician whose name I found on your

										</h4>
										<div class="card">
											The listing of an individual in our database does not imply any connection to
											the Department of geology at North Dakota State University or the American
											Geology  Society. Because of the tremendous number of mathematicians in our
											database, we are unable to maintain current contact information for them. You
											might try searching the Combined Membership List of the major American and
											Canadian Geology  organizations. Back to top.

											Will you provide a link from my genealogy page to my personal or work home page?
										</h4>
										<div class="card">
											No. We are kept busy adding new records to our database and correcting errors in
											existing records; our limited time and budget do not allow us to keep up-to-date
											website links for mathematicians in our database. Back to top.

										<h4>

											Where do you get your data?
										</h4>
										<div class="card">
											We depend on information from our visitors for most of our data. In cases of
											partial information, we search Dissertation Abstracts International in an effort
											to find complete information. We have also entered a considerable amount of data
											found on lists of graduates maintained by individual departments. If you have
											data to provide, our submission form is the best way to submit it. For large
											quantities of data, you may contact us about other means of submitting. Back to

										<h4>

											How complete is your data?
										</h4>
										<div class="card">
											For recent PhD graduates from American universities our data is fairly complete.
											We have received complete data lists from the majority of the PhD-granting
											geology departments in the United States (with some notable exceptions), but
											our coverage of universities in other countries is not so good (particularly
											Asian countries). We are also still working on acquiring complete data from
											departments of computer science and statistics (which fall within our definition
											of "mathematician") around the world. If you can provide us with data or a
											person to contact about acquiring data at a particular institution, please
											contact us. Back to top.

										<h4>
											What do the flags on mathematicians' pages represent?
										</h4>
										<div class="card">
											The flags displayed on mathematicians' pages are intended to represent the
											country of the school from which they received their degree(s). In some cases,
											we have inadvertently omitted the appropriate link to provide the flag. You may
											contact us to have this corrected. Back to top.

									The geology Genealogy Project only catalogs the information displayed on our site.
									In most
									cases, we have done this through data submitted by our site's visitors. Thus, we have
									never even
									seen a copy of the thesis, let alone made an archival copy of it. If you are really
									interested
									in getting ahold of a thesis, you might try contacting the library at the university
									that
									granted the degree. (No, we do not maintain contact information for such libraries, so
									please do
									not email us to ask.)
