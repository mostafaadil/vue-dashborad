        <p class="mb-0">This seller was great overall. One thing I noticed was that there was one logo out of the 4 I got that stood out amongst the others. Now I loved that one logo but the other ones did not look like much thought were put into them and they were a little disappointing. It is understandable for the price for them to only put effort into one logo, which like I said I loved. I think it would be better to tell this seller to make one good logo and to provide 3 other logos that work off the one good logo. Maybe make that one good logo and then change colors and fonts for the other 3. But overall this seller was great!</p>
